You know what I mean?\\n\\nHi reader,\\n\\nThis is my first letter to you. Thank you for picking up Cycles. I both hope, for your own sake, that you do not relate to the bulk of its contents and, for my own selfish need to find empathy in others, that you do see yourself in a poem or two. If you don’t know me, hello. It’s nice to meet you. My name is Miya. I am scared of crossing the street when the light is red, even without a car in sight. Sometimes, I set out on walks only to stop at random, just to see what I can find. My soul gravitates to large cities; I find peace in the bustle. I believe good art can change the trajectory of your day, maybe even your life. Cheesy? Yes. True? Also yes. At least for me. \\n\\nIn 2022, I published a little poetry book, Full, with my dear friend, Aurelia. Together, we explored the breadth of the human experience: the desire to create, to connect, to comprehend the world that we are living in. I found myself on an enormous high after its release, and, for a multitude of reasons and life changes, soon found myself in a tremendous low shortly after. \\n\\nFor every time I felt proud of my accomplishments, my mind became a Times Square of self-doubt: billboard bold letters that I am lacking, that I do not deserve any ounce of praise, that I have not done enough. I would lie awake at night and blame myself for the lack of sleep. The person I used to be never had this problem. The person I used to be would have handled this better. The person I used to be was happy. Why couldn’t I be her? Why couldn’t I let the joy last? Why is it that every time I climb a mountain I remind myself that I will fall? Why does this happen over and over and over again?\\n\\nAt the end of every relationship, I found myself unphased; I felt so secure in my self-worth and knew what I had to offer. I was still whole without the people who left. My world kept turning. 95% of the time. In sporadic bursts, everything I assured myself and others I didn’t feel–the anger, the grieving, the sadness–all poured out of me and into my poetry. The more I wrote about it, the more I felt my foundations shake. I was sure I was okay. I was sure I was over it. Why does it all keep rushing back? The more I wrote, the more I felt like I was lying to myself and to others. I felt like a fraud and a stranger in my reflection.\\n\\nAnd like a sunburst, Cycles was born. Deeply personal (and by consequence, vulnerable), the following anthology explore my recent ranges of emotion, from fears that I can never seem to definitively quiet to perspective shifts to see myself in a whole new light. A collection of poems, letters, and illustrations, I hope to let you all catch a glimpse of who I am in the way I best know how to. Thank you for joining me on my journey, turbulence and all. \\n\\nMiya\\nWhenever it’s convenient!\\n\\nScreaming\\nI want you to see me\\nPlease could you just fucking look\\n\\nPleading\\nI made it so easy\\nI wrote it all in this fucking book\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n*Larger than Life \\n\\nBiding my time,\\nI am in no rush.\\nPaintbrush bristle fingertips\\ngentle, circle\\nalong my skin, dip\\nin my aura, mix \\nin the color.\\n\\nBending my timelines,\\nthe longer I bathe in \\nthe memories, the most potent \\nfloat to the surface, materializing \\nin pigment, watercolor washes \\nfrom the fervor I work in.\\nAn outpouring on a spatial plane,\\na colored canvas, a place\\nto be.\\n\\nSurrounded by the canary yellow\\nof long-awaited reunions,\\nshiny obsidian sleepless nights, \\nthe duochrome of leaving home.\\nVivid, the world I live in.\\nCapture it and share it, \\nmy essence in every facet.\\nAbstract, but not.\\nArtistry!

Your writing is repetitive. Say something new. Be you. Be original. Be fresh. Be authentic. You wrote this before. This doesn’t sound like you. No one will get this. No one even wants to get it. You are delusional. Why do you think you’re important? Why do you think this matters? How you feel does not matter. You do not matter. You are embarrassing yourself. You are embarrassing the people who love you. You are untalented. You are ordinary. You don’t know what you’re doing. You are an affront to real artists. Real poets. Real people with real struggles. You need to stop. You only think about yourself. Your “art” is so self-centered. You are so full of yourself.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere is something here.

A pivotal figure in the road to who I presently am, yet I can’t seem to remember clearly. The steps I have taken are covered by thick fog. I feel estranged from myself. Everything I do further makes a stranger out of me. I write to capture myself. I edit because the self I captured is not good enough. Rewrite after rewrite after rewrite.

I didn’t know how to smile until my mid-teens. I thought my happiness was directly correlated to the wideness of my facial expression. This resulted in too many a family photo with my mouth stretched like the Joker and my eyes open as if I had not blinked in days. I walked so my hair bounced with every step, and I leapt at an uneven rhythm, letting the urge take over whenever it chose to fall upon me. I imagined reading storybooks to sleepy animals, cooing at and shushing their invisible silhouettes until my bell-ringing voice called them from the pastures they grazed in. Every night, I would chat on the phone, cycling through my friends until I had heard the voice of everyone I cherished. Summer days sparkled like diamonds and I never thought they would lose their shine.\\n\\nI moved around a lot as a child. It still makes me sad to leave a place. My once immutable smile shifted to one tinged with sadness, quivering as tears sprung from the natural geysers of my eyes. As my family’s packed car veered on the highway, my childhood home on the horizon, I let my friends’ voice repeat in my head. I hope you never change. I hope you never change. I let my whole world collapse into itself, folding neatly like a pop-up book shutting its covers. I encapsulated and documented everything I knew about myself and left it suspended in packing peanuts and newspaper wrappings. Never to be touched again.\\n\\nI packed myself into a box that day, holding onto I hope you never change as a commandment. To be strong of character, I can never let my character sway. I am a home for people who have long forgotten my name, an artifact of a point in their life they could never get back. In this way, they never lost me, and I, in turn, never have to come to terms that I had lost them a long time ago. The light bulb on the porch kept flickering until its eventual surrender, and even then I have not been able to change it. Now, the people I loved walk through the night, oblivious that I am still on the front porch waiting. I fantasize they will see me and see that I, indeed, have not changed. And I will ignore the shift in their tone and the wariness on their face, as I bound inside the house, hair streaming behind me, cleaning up cobwebs and dusting off chairs. It’s easier to clean the interiors than worry whether anyone is actually following me inside.\\n\\n\\n\\nCurrents\\n\\nIt starts with the water.\\nThe beast that once shook with power\\nnow hibernating and still.\\nYou kick your feet in its depths\\nand a weak ripple quickly quiets itself.\\nFlat.

Twenty hours in recycled air and the same chair, sitting nicely at cruising altitude. A constant whir in the air and the occasional beep of the seatbelt sign. Three coughs. Two babbling babies. It took all this for me to finally hear myself, for me to get past everything and, in perhaps full frustration, realize I knew exactly what I wanted to hear. I just wanted to stop blaming myself. I wanted to stop treating me like someone I hated. I wanted to stop feeling like I had to be someone else.\\n\\nAdmittedly I came to this grand realization and then, over the course of a year, continued on my cycles. This wasn’t the ending I wanted to give. I wanted to come to this groundbreaking conclusion of how to end the cycles that I have grown so tired of. Well, here is the truth (my truth).\\n\\nSome cycles never end and I am finally okay with it. That's the key. Being okay with it. I don't blame myself for falling in them anymore. I don't blame myself for foolishness. I don't blame myself for trusting the wrong people. I don't blame myself for never truly forgiving. I don’t blame myself for changing, for being a different person in different stages of my life. I don’t blame myself for struggling or for grief or for sitting in a rut when I needed to. \\n\\nI am okay. And when I am not, I know I am trying to be. That’s enough.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConclusions\\n\\nThat’s it? You didn’t solve anything.\\n\\nI wasn’t trying to. \\n\\nAll this was a waste of time.\\n\\nI don’t believe in wastes of time. \\n\\nOkay. Pretentious.\\n\\nOkay. Is that really it?\\n\\n(empty page)\\n\\nThen, what were you trying to do?\\n\\nI wrote this book because I am building empathy for myself. I write things and reread them and forget I felt them. I am not letting you be some nebulous voice in my head anymore. I am not fighting this invisible obstacle anymore. I am committing you to paper. I am giving you the voice you’ve been tearing at me to have. I finally just want to hear what you’re saying. And you’re saying you’re hurt. And you feel guilt for things that you have done or things you let happen. I am building patience and grace for a kid who just wanted to love. I am not a waste of time. In the exact same way that you aren’t either. I’m not mad at myself for the cycles anymore. The cycles are just pieces of myself I’ve dropped along the way asking to be heard, to be held. And now, with the things I never thought I’d share printed in ink, I’ve never felt more whole.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTo the person I was at 18:\\n\\nI have written a lot of things in my life, but this is my first letter to you. Direct. No metaphors. Just us. My gut instinct was that the first thing I needed to tell you was I am sorry. I am sorry for how I misunderstood you. I am sorry for how I blamed you. I am sorry that I thought you were ever not good enough. However, this exploration isn’t about the things I didn’t do. I want it to be about the things you did do. \\n\\nThank you for seeing the good in people. I forgot how to do that. I am trying to remember.\\n\\nThank you for loving. Thank you for everything you did in the pursuit of loving the most, loving fully and deeply, and not being afraid of vulnerability.  \\n\\nThank you for feeling everything you do. Thank you for holding my hand down my path, even when I didn’t know it. Even when I blamed you that I was on it. \\n\\nThank you for your strength. Your wisdom. Your joy. Everything that encompasses you.\\n\\nI want to tell you that, at 26, we finally feel our age. I feel capable. I feel at peace. I feel everything, and I love that. It still makes you feel sad when the sun takes its rest for the season, but you found the places the sun has stored itself into. The spark you started, the spark I thought I lost, it’s here. It’s always been here. You have people you love, and they love you, too. Some people still leave, but, ultimately, they were meant to. We have never been more whole.\\n\\nThe lane is open. We can do anything we want. \\n\\n\\n\\n*Handwritten\\n\\nFor someone who writes the same things over and over, I did it enough to fill an entire book. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEverything \\nmy mind has \\ntouched \\nhas turned to \\ngold.\\n\\nIt glimmers. \\nIt shifts. \\nIt evades \\nyour ill wishes.\\nArtistic Vision\\n\\nI close my eyes— \\nmy mind places me \\nbarefoot \\non rocky pacific shores. \\nWearing nothing but a loose dress, \\nthin, colorless, and \\npainfully unequipped  \\nto shield me from the cold. \\nMy skin sticks from the salty air; \\nmy untied hair battered from violent gusts; \\nmy eyes squinting \\nto find where the sky meets the sea, \\nlike searching for a line in a  \\nwatercolor canvas of  \\nmelancholy blues,  \\ndomineering grays, and  \\napathetic white. \\nThankfully, I am alone here, \\nfor when the ocean pushes against the land,\\nno one but \\nme \\nwill be swept in its undertow.\\nArtistic Shifting\\n\\nI close my eyes–\\nmy mind places me\\nbarefoot \\non prairie plateaus.\\nWearing nothing but a loose dress,\\nthin, slipping\\noff my shoulder \\nin the solitude of youthful innocence.\\nPerfectly equipped\\nto magnetize warm rays \\nto bronze skin.\\nWalking in fields of wheat,\\ngolden grains \\nburst\\nat a single touch.\\nCotton like confetti carried\\nby a singular wind \\nin an otherwise frozen scene.\\nThankfully, I am alone here,\\nfor this paradise bounty is mine \\nand mind derived. \\nNo one but \\nme\\ncan seep its nectar.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Narcissist’s Manifesto\\n\\nWe are narcissists.

And we have been made to believe that is a bad thing.\\n\\nDon’t think too highly of yourself; don't be a narcissist. \\nDon’t take up too much space; don’t be a narcissist. \\nDon’t seek admiration; don’t be a narcissist. \\n\\nDon’t be a narcissist; don’t be the person that no one wants around. We have weaponized narcissism to the point that we stifle our beings and spit on our work. We are painted smiles and “don’t worry about me” assurances that walk with the guilt that we still, despite this label and all its threats, undeniably feel the pull to share ourselves. We creep around the outskirts of pride, peering in, and wonder if we have snuck into territories we shouldn’t have. The fence is barbed, and the signs are clear, and they all say that we don’t have anything important to say. So we’ll turn away.\\n\\nWhen did it become scarier to be a narcissist than to live a life without having left anything behind? When did we become so afraid of connecting? When did we become so numb? I look at screens more often than I look people in the eyes. I put the meaning of humanity in my jacket before I bolted out my door to catch the train. I rode 6 stops downtown and flew through the turnstiles and ran down the street and I have found myself here, not a penny to my name and not a thought in my pocket.\\n\\nI’ve lived this way my whole life. I am trapped alone in a box of frosted glass blocks. I squint to decipher the outside and know I cannot no matter how hard I try. I know if I could see, I would see you: you’d be stuck, just like me, in your own little prison that only you recognize. Have you tried to survive like me? I’ve hung personalities like ornaments to reflect light in their facets. I thought they would help me shine further so I could tell myself that I had reached you. Did I reach you? Or have you given up like me? I am sitting in this enclosure, fully adorned with so many papier mâché versions of myself that I can no longer see who I am, let alone see outside. What is the point in trying? We are all screaming in our own little vessels and no one is able to hear.\\n\\nThis cannot be my world. Our worlds are meant to be open. Our worlds are meant to intersect. I am supposed to see you, and I swore I have before. Now I am not so sure. I’ve been so afraid of being myself. I’ve been so afraid of being unwanted. I’ve been so afraid of being a narcissist. I write because I must change. I write because I must share. Not because I am unique, because of the very fact that I am not. I long for the light I have lost and I am actively aiming to find it. The sun is rising. Can you feel its warmth? It is leaking into your shell and mine, from now until the end of time.\\n\\nMemories and feelings, hints of humanity, hit me. Sometimes like a touch. Sometimes like a truck. I am everywhere because you are everywhere. I am everywhere because you are reading this. I am everywhere because you hear my voice even if you do not. I am trying to let you in. This is the way I know how to. This art is for the scared. This art is for the brave. This art is for the static. This art is for those who seek it. I cross barriers, translating my world into something you can enter. You can do whatever you want with it, with me. I’ll still stand. I’ll still sew your outlines into my skin. I’ll still take up the space I rightfully deserve.\\n\\nPut on paper, my experience is no longer mine alone. It is yours as I now am. It is my greatest honor to be woven into your peripherals. My words are my strength. My words are my eyes. My words spread like pollen. I’ve blown my wishes into dandelions. They fly further through wings and paws and whispers and songs. My words are my greatest gift. I was always meant to be a vessel for them.\\n\\nWhat a compliment it is to be so full of myself.\\n\\n\\nClarifications\\n\\n“The world is violent and mercurial – it will have its way with you. We are saved only by love – love for each other and the love that we pour into the art we feel compelled to share: being a parent; being a writer; being a painter; being a friend. We live in a perpetually burning building, and what we must save from it, all the time, is love.”\\n\\nTennessee Williams\\n\\n\\n\\nI know the world is not about me. I know I am just a blip in the scale of a magnificent timeline of magnificent (and not magnificent) human existences. In the face of tragedy after tragedy, every news story that numbs us to the reality of the world, I stand in the face of it, shriveled and small. With so many issues that feel more pressing, so paramount in their importance, so pervasive in their effects, who was I to take up more space? How utterly selfish of me to make art about myself in a world where bombs go off on innocents and children worry if their light-up shoes will be their cause of death in a school lockdown. \\n\\nThis isn’t the narrative.\\n\\nThe individual matters. I matter. You matter. We all matter.  \\n\\nPeople don’t deserve to die because the individual matters. I cannot be frightened into submission, that my actions mean nothing, when the individual has built this world. Just as it was built, we can unbuild and rebuild, and that is what we must do. That is what we must remember.\\n\\nI want to build a world that is open and free and vulnerable and sheltering. I want to build a world where taking up space does not mean that I am taking from another; it means we all have a right to be in the world as we were designed to be. \\n\\nI have always wanted to build. I just have no more interest in tearing myself down to do so.\\n\\nShe\\n\\nShe swings her hair, she sways her hips\\nShe runs my thumb against her lip\\n\\nShe feasts on auras, she mirrors looks\\nShe stamps her initials in library books\\n\\nShe hammers, she nails\\nShe trips down the stairs\\n\\nShe sets the fire, she stands to watch\\nShe washes her hands of the blood\\n\\nShe is honeysuckle, she is wheat\\nShe spills her fragrance in the streets \\n\\nShe glows, she brims\\nShe sewed her outlines into my skin\\n\\nShe is inferno incarnate\\nlife sustaining and strong\\n\\nShe is magic and whimsy and \\nwriting on the walls\\n\\nShe will not fade though she cannot be\\nShe is all we see \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPoetry is in the gaps \\n\\nYou can find me in the crevices.\\nBagel crumbs and social anxiety.\\nWinding walks finding tiny rocks.\\nTaking notice when no one else does.\\nWords I string along and choose to call\\nart.\\n\\nYou can find me in the pause.\\nThe breath between words.\\nSoil beneath worlds. \\nAir taking meaning in hopes \\nyou might see me. \\n\\nYou can find me in the ending.\\nPages settled and papercut stings.\\nBeyond pretty words in a bounded box.\\nWaiting with my past as the future is\\nBeginning.\\nText bubble that shows conversation\\n\\nWe finished Full and this wonderful collection of myself and someone very dear to me was sitting before me.

A modest suggestion to read poetry together every week one fateful winter night (a night notably colder for one author, not basking in the balmy California climate) turned into a regularly scheduled celebration of the written word. After a few months of simply reading, our own emotions and ideas ripened to bursting; thus we decided to end our mere consumption and take up the inky pen (or clackity keyboard). Nervous prefaces prior to reading our poems, after some weeks of writing and sharing, soon grew scarce. We unearthed newfound confidence in both our individual creative abilities and the trust that our most vulnerable musings would be met with unending empathy and warmth. We continued to challenge ourselves, creating new tasks to complete every week. Finally, we decided that what began as an off-hand comment was something that deserved to be shared—and thus this project was born. Our circle of safety where we shared our thoughts is expanding its radius ever so slightly. \\n\\tThe astute reader may notice that we seem to copy a few of each other’s lines throughout the anthology—and it’s no slip of the pen. Many of our poems started as shared lines of inspiration—a shared theme, key word or sometimes, direct inspiration from a previous poem. It provided a means for us to evoke a similar theme and explore topics together. When you notice these, just think of them as sister poems, born from the same idea, mood and week of inspiration.\\nOur initial conception of this book opted to host sections containing the “themes” of our poems—but we decided that such a structure would deny our poems the living breath they hold. The initial idea of compartmentalizing our poems emerged from a bristling fear of our feelings being somehow less legible unless somehow sorted neatly into boxes. Luckily, our fears found respite in our confidence in each other. We envision our anthology as a turbulent movement—each flowing (not seamlessly) into the next. That is to say, each poem stands well-defined on its own but to isolate them would be to deny them their becoming life. They share their deepest intimacies with their neighbors just as we the authors have done in our many meetings. We humbly thank you for doing so, as the addition of your own experiences and perspectives adds color to our art in ways we could have never imagined. \\n\\n\\nThrough These Words\\nBy Miya\\n\\nMy fingertips caress this soft page,\\nBent and worn with every clutch\\nUpon the unexpected.

       " 'This is my first letter to you. Thank you for picking up Cycles. I both hope, for your own sake, that you do not relate to the bulk of its contents and, for my own selfish need to find empathy in others, that you do see yourself in a poem or two. If you don’t know me, hello. It’s nice to meet you. My name is Miya. I am scared of crossing the street when the light is red, even without a car in sight. Sometimes, I set out on walks only to stop at random, just to see what I can find. My soul gravitates to large cities; I find peace in the bustle. I believe good art can change the trajectory of your day, maybe even your life. Cheesy? Yes. True? Also yes. At least for me. ',\n",
       " 'In 2022, I published a little poetry book, Full, with my dear friend, Aurelia. Together, we explored the breadth of the human experience: the desire to create, to connect, to comprehend the world that we are living in. I found myself on an enormous high after its release, and, for a multitude of reasons and life changes, soon found myself in a tremendous low shortly after. ',\n",
       " 'For every time I felt proud of my accomplishments, my mind became a Times Square of self-doubt: billboard bold letters that I am lacking, that I do not deserve any ounce of praise, that I have not done enough. I would lie awake at night and blame myself for the lack of sleep. The person I used to be never had this problem. The person I used to be would have handled this better. The person I used to be was happy. Why couldn’t I be her? Why couldn’t I let the joy last? Why is it that every time I climb a mountain I remind myself that I will fall? Why does this happen over and over and over again?',\n",
       " 'At the end of every relationship, I found myself unphased; I felt so secure in my self-worth and knew what I had to offer. I was still whole without the people who left. My world kept turning. 95% of the time. In sporadic bursts, everything I assured myself and others I didn’t feel–the anger, the grieving, the sadness–all poured out of me and into my poetry. The more I wrote about it, the more I felt my foundations shake. I was sure I was okay. I was sure I was over it. Why does it all keep rushing back? The more I wrote, the more I felt like I was lying to myself and to others. I felt like a fraud and a stranger in my reflection.',\n",

Deeply personal (and by consequence, vulnerable), the following anthology explore my recent ranges of emotion, from fears that I can never seem to definitively quiet to perspective shifts to see myself in a whole new light.

I made this series of poems to explore the associated jumble emotions orbiting around heartbreak: loss, anger, questioning, to name a few. Through a series of metaphors, I sought to visualize and illustrate the changes that are so embedded in that state of mind, a worldview that is often invisible to those around. I thought deeply about the ways that image shifts and reverts in the healing process, yet as a whole felt like a singular feeling. Although each poem asks a different question, ultimately I found their answers to be the same and underlying within the words I was writing. ',\n",

       " 'The creation of this book comes as a surprise to no one more than us, two acquaintances, three time zones apart, who shared a brief online conversation perhaps once a month before beginning this project. A modest suggestion to read poetry together every week one fateful winter night (a night notably colder for one author, not basking in the balmy California climate) turned into a regularly scheduled celebration of the written word. After a few months of simply reading, our own emotions and ideas ripened to bursting; thus we decided to end our mere consumption and take up the inky pen (or clackity keyboard). Nervous prefaces prior to reading our poems, after some weeks of writing and sharing, soon grew scarce. We unearthed newfound confidence in both our individual creative abilities and the trust that our most vulnerable musings would be met with unending empathy and warmth. We continued to challenge ourselves, creating new tasks to complete every week. Finally, we decided that what began as an off-hand comment was something that deserved to be shared—and thus this project was born. Our circle of safety where we shared our thoughts is expanding its radius ever so slightly. \\n\\tThe astute reader may notice that we seem to copy a few of each other’s lines throughout the anthology—and it’s no slip of the pen. Many of our poems started as shared lines of inspiration—a shared theme, key word or sometimes, direct inspiration from a previous poem. It provided a means for us to evoke a similar theme and explore topics together. When you notice these, just think of them as sister poems, born from the same idea, mood and week of inspiration.\\nOur initial conception of this book opted to host sections containing the “themes” of our poems—but we decided that such a structure would deny our poems the living breath they hold. The initial idea of compartmentalizing our poems emerged from a bristling fear of our feelings being somehow less legible unless somehow sorted neatly into boxes. Luckily, our fears found respite in our confidence in each other. We envision our anthology as a turbulent movement—each flowing (not seamlessly) into the next. That is to say, each poem stands well-defined on its own but to isolate them would be to deny them their becoming life. They share their deepest intimacies with their neighbors just as we the authors have done in our many meetings. We humbly thank you for doing so, as the addition of your own experiences and perspectives adds color to our art in ways we could have never imagined. ',\n",

If you don’t know me, hello. It’s nice to meet you. My name is Miya. I am scared of crossing the street when the light is red, even without a car in sight. Sometimes, I set out on walks only to stop at random, just to see what I can find. My soul gravitates to large cities; I find peace in the bustle. I believe good art can change the trajectory of your day, maybe even your life. Cheesy? Yes. True? Also yes. At least for me. ',\n",

Why does this happen over and over and over again?',\n",

My world kept turning. 95% of the time. In sporadic bursts, everything I assured myself and others I didn’t feel–the anger, the grieving, the sadness–all poured out of me and into my poetry. The more I wrote about it, the more I felt my foundations shake. I was sure I was okay. I was sure I was over it. Why does it all keep rushing back?

       " 'The creation of this book comes as a surprise to no one more than us, two acquaintances, three time zones apart, who shared a brief online conversation perhaps once a month before beginning this project. A modest suggestion to read poetry together every week one fateful winter night (a night notably colder for one author, not basking in the balmy California climate) turned into a regularly scheduled celebration of the written word. After a few months of simply reading, our own emotions and ideas ripened to bursting; thus we decided to end our mere consumption and take up the inky pen (or clackity keyboard). Nervous prefaces prior to reading our poems, after some weeks of writing and sharing, soon grew scarce. We unearthed newfound confidence in both our individual creative abilities and the trust that our most vulnerable musings would be met with unending empathy and warmth. We continued to challenge ourselves, creating new tasks to complete every week. Finally, we decided that what began as an off-hand comment was something that deserved to be shared—and thus this project was born. Our circle of safety where we shared our thoughts is expanding its radius ever so slightly. \\n\\tThe astute reader may notice that we seem to copy a few of each other’s lines throughout the anthology—and it’s no slip of the pen. Many of our poems started as shared lines of inspiration—a shared theme, key word or sometimes, direct inspiration from a previous poem. It provided a means for us to evoke a similar theme and explore topics together. When you notice these, just think of them as sister poems, born from the same idea, mood and week of inspiration.\\nOur initial conception of this book opted to host sections containing the “themes” of our poems—but we decided that such a structure would deny our poems the living breath they hold. The initial idea of compartmentalizing our poems emerged from a bristling fear of our feelings being somehow less legible unless somehow sorted neatly into boxes. Luckily, our fears found respite in our confidence in each other. We envision our anthology as a turbulent movement—each flowing (not seamlessly) into the next. That is to say, each poem stands well-defined on its own but to isolate them would be to deny them their becoming life. They share their deepest intimacies with their neighbors just as we the authors have done in our many meetings. We humbly thank you for doing so, as the addition of your own experiences and perspectives adds color to our art in ways we could have never imagined. ',\n",

Thinking through this, I think it would be better to try again by separating the poems first. Based on what came out of the others, it looks like each poem is separated by 3 line breaks, not 2."

       "'\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nCycles can be stupid. You know what I mean?\\n\\nHi reader,\\n\\nThis is my first letter to you. Thank you for picking up Cycles. I both hope, for your own sake, that you do not relate to the bulk of its contents and, for my own selfish need to find empathy in others, that you do see yourself in a poem or two. If you don’t know me, hello. It’s nice to meet you. My name is Miya. I am scared of crossing the street when the light is red, even without a car in sight. Sometimes, I set out on walks only to stop at random, just to see what I can find. My soul gravitates to large cities; I find peace in the bustle. I believe good art can change the trajectory of your day, maybe even your life. Cheesy? Yes. True? Also yes. At least for me. \\n\\nIn 2022, I published a little poetry book, Full, with my dear friend, Aurelia. Together, we explored the breadth of the human experience: the desire to create, to connect, to comprehend the world that we are living in. I found myself on an enormous high after its release, and, for a multitude of reasons and life changes, soon found myself in a tremendous low shortly after. \\n\\nFor every time I felt proud of my accomplishments, my mind became a Times Square of self-doubt: billboard bold letters that I am lacking, that I do not deserve any ounce of praise, that I have not done enough. I would lie awake at night and blame myself for the lack of sleep. The person I used to be never had this problem. The person I used to be would have handled this better. The person I used to be was happy. Why couldn’t I be her? Why couldn’t I let the joy last? Why is it that every time I climb a mountain I remind myself that I will fall? Why does this happen over and over and over again?\\n\\nAt the end of every relationship, I found myself unphased; I felt so secure in my self-worth and knew what I had to offer. I was still whole without the people who left. My world kept turning. 95% of the time. In sporadic bursts, everything I assured myself and others I didn’t feel–the anger, the grieving, the sadness–all poured out of me and into my poetry. The more I wrote about it, the more I felt my foundations shake. I was sure I was okay. I was sure I was over it. Why does it all keep rushing back? The more I wrote, the more I felt like I was lying to myself and to others. I felt like a fraud and a stranger in my reflection.\\n\\nAnd like a sunburst, Cycles was born. Deeply personal (and by consequence, vulnerable), the following anthology explore my recent ranges of emotion, from fears that I can never seem to definitively quiet to perspective shifts to see myself in a whole new light. A collection of poems, letters, and illustrations, I hope to let you all catch a glimpse of who I am in the way I best know how to. Thank you for joining me on my journey, turbulence and all. '"

A modest suggestion to read poetry together every week one fateful winter night (a night notably colder for one author, not basking in the balmy California climate) turned into a regularly scheduled celebration of the written word. After a few months of simply reading, our own emotions and ideas ripened to bursting; thus we decided to end our mere consumption and take up the inky pen (or clackity keyboard). Nervous prefaces prior to reading our poems, after some weeks of writing and sharing, soon grew scarce. We unearthed newfound confidence in both our individual creative abilities and the trust that our most vulnerable musings would be met with unending empathy and warmth. We continued to challenge ourselves, creating new tasks to complete every week. Finally, we decided that what began as an off-hand comment was something that deserved to be shared—and thus this project was born. Our circle of safety where we shared our thoughts is expanding its radius ever so slightly. \\n\\tThe astute reader may notice that we seem to copy a few of each other’s lines throughout the anthology—and it’s no slip of the pen. Many of our poems started as shared lines of inspiration—a shared theme, key word or sometimes, direct inspiration from a previous poem. It provided a means for us to evoke a similar theme and explore topics together. When you notice these, just think of them as sister poems, born from the same idea, mood and week of inspiration.\\nOur initial conception of this book opted to host sections containing the “themes” of our poems—but we decided that such a structure would deny our poems the living breath they hold. The initial idea of compartmentalizing our poems emerged from a bristling fear of our feelings being somehow less legible unless somehow sorted neatly into boxes. Luckily, our fears found respite in our confidence in each other. We envision our anthology as a turbulent movement—each flowing (not seamlessly) into the next. That is to say, each poem stands well-defined on its own but to isolate them would be to deny them their becoming life. They share their deepest intimacies with their neighbors just as we the authors have done in our many meetings. We humbly thank you for doing so, as the addition of your own experiences and perspectives adds color to our art in ways we could have never imagined. ']\n",

I both hope, for your own sake, that you do not relate to the bulk of its contents and, for my own selfish need to find empathy in others, that you do see yourself in a poem or two. If you don’t know me, hello. It’s nice to meet you. My name is Miya. I am scared of crossing the street when the light is red, even without a car in sight. Sometimes, I set out on walks only to stop at random, just to see what I can find. My soul gravitates to large cities; I find peace in the bustle. I believe good art can change the trajectory of your day, maybe even your life. Cheesy? Yes. True? Also yes. At least for me. ',\n",

The more I wrote about it, the more I felt my foundations shake. I was sure I was okay. I was sure I was over it. Why does it all keep rushing back?

       " ['The creation of this book comes as a surprise to no one more than us, two acquaintances, three time zones apart, who shared a brief online conversation perhaps once a month before beginning this project. A modest suggestion to read poetry together every week one fateful winter night (a night notably colder for one author, not basking in the balmy California climate) turned into a regularly scheduled celebration of the written word. After a few months of simply reading, our own emotions and ideas ripened to bursting; thus we decided to end our mere consumption and take up the inky pen (or clackity keyboard). Nervous prefaces prior to reading our poems, after some weeks of writing and sharing, soon grew scarce. We unearthed newfound confidence in both our individual creative abilities and the trust that our most vulnerable musings would be met with unending empathy and warmth. We continued to challenge ourselves, creating new tasks to complete every week. Finally, we decided that what began as an off-hand comment was something that deserved to be shared—and thus this project was born. Our circle of safety where we shared our thoughts is expanding its radius ever so slightly. \\n\\tThe astute reader may notice that we seem to copy a few of each other’s lines throughout the anthology—and it’s no slip of the pen. Many of our poems started as shared lines of inspiration—a shared theme, key word or sometimes, direct inspiration from a previous poem. It provided a means for us to evoke a similar theme and explore topics together. When you notice these, just think of them as sister poems, born from the same idea, mood and week of inspiration.\\nOur initial conception of this book opted to host sections containing the “themes” of our poems—but we decided that such a structure would deny our poems the living breath they hold. The initial idea of compartmentalizing our poems emerged from a bristling fear of our feelings being somehow less legible unless somehow sorted neatly into boxes. Luckily, our fears found respite in our confidence in each other. We envision our anthology as a turbulent movement—each flowing (not seamlessly) into the next. That is to say, each poem stands well-defined on its own but to isolate them would be to deny them their becoming life. They share their deepest intimacies with their neighbors just as we the authors have done in our many meetings. We humbly thank you for doing so, as the addition of your own experiences and perspectives adds color to our art in ways we could have never imagined. '],\n",
