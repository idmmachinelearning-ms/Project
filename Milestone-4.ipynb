    "I think the model takes more neutral words and deems them positive. The scoring could be a fun thing to add into a dataframe and then do analysis. But then the data frame would have to change to have each word as an entry rather than a poem. Perhaps the poem could be likened to a label, like we have done in other exercises. This could give more opportunity to look at covariances. Maybe the new goal is to cluster poems together based on similar sentiment overall scores? \n"
