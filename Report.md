### Introduction
A large part of my thesis work is the idea of subjective analysis. How would you describe the person you are in the world? How would you describe yourself as an artist? As a poet, there is a double-edged sword that comes with the genre. A piece may be borne from an especially painful time, but because many poems intentionally leave open space for interpretation, sometimes the original sentiments the piece was written with become lost to the reader. Artists, but perhaps (very biased) especially poets, must toe the line between legibility and abstraction. The art of poetry is in the abstraction, creating gaps in meaning, in words, in the ways "normal" language is used, but abstract too much and you are left with muddled, incomprehensible art that has taken on entirely new meaning. Because of this, I feel there is a gap between how I feel about my poetry and how my poetry "objectively" is. Does it immediately make it a sad poem if I wrote it when I was sad? I am fascinated in the differences of opinion Miya the artist has versus Miya the reader has. However, try as I might, it is impossible for me to fully remove the bias that Miya the artist has in viewing my poetry. Python data analysis helps contribute a new view on my work. 

### Modeling/Analysis Techniques
- what you wanted to do, what you ended up doing

### What happened
plots, graphs were used as part of the analysis. 

### Conclusion
what this means, further steps to take, a different direction, final thoughts
