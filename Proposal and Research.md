### Introduction
I am part of a generation that has grown up with and been a key driving force in the expansion of technological innovation. With the rise of artificial intelligence and machine learning systems, current and future generations entangle not only with unprecedented technological abilities, but also unforeseen dangers. I aim to understand the capabilities and limitations of generative machine learning programs, challenging the notions that these systems are robbing artists of their creative practice not by ignoring or disavowing the real instances in which plagiarism has occurred, but by reclaiming our human agency with these tools and what we use them for. The existence of ChatGPT and other generative AI programs does not inherently challenge human creativity and artistry; people who use these programs to usurp others’ work do. For example, choosing to train models on others’ art without obtaining due consent is a matter of ethics. Instead of placing the blame on technology, I argue for shifting the accountability to the technologists who made it and the individuals who misuse it. My goal as an artist is to show how we can use these tools to open up new avenues for creativity in an ethically conscious way through contributions to the field of digital poetry. 

Through my work as an MA candidate at NYU, I have integrated the outputs of refined machine learning models into my writing. After assembling a corpus of my work, I used it to fuel two models built with the Python programming language: one using Markov chain probability and one using generative machine learning. The former simply makes predictions of what word will come next based on the words used in the dataset it is fed, while the latter will use knowledge of the English dictionary and the voice of the information it was trained on in order to form words or phrases and thus using words outside the corpus. I have chosen to use only my own words in the training of these models. Although I cannot control what outputs are generated from the model, I am responsible as I am the one who wrote the work it was trained on, the one who built the model, and the one who decided which outputs would be used in the creation of my art. 

For my final project, I hope to use units of original poetry as datapoints to create a more complex model than I created in other projects.

### Research
I am inspired by Allison Parrish's work in computer-generated poetry. I also reference readings in this class that talk about the ethics of datasets, and it is a core topic in my thesis work. Using my own work is coding the model and understanding how the model works is vital to my artistic practice in this field. I am also asking and researching the following questions: What does it mean to use programmed tools to write poetry? How can I adequately provide context in how these machines work, both in my poetry and in broader societal use? What does it mean to use these technologies, technologies that can often refract self-image, as a way to see myself? How can I acknowledge the privilege it takes to conduct experiments like this, knowing that machine learning models utilize enormous amounts of energy? Will these works further anthropomorphize technology as I have a “conversation” with a digital self I created?
