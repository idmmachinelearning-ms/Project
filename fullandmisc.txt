Introduction

Cycles can be stupid. You know what I mean?

Hi reader,

This is my first letter to you. Thank you for picking up Cycles. I both hope, for your own sake, that you do not relate to the bulk of its contents and, for my own selfish need to find empathy in others, that you do see yourself in a poem or two. If you don’t know me, hello. It’s nice to meet you. My name is Miya. I am scared of crossing the street when the light is red, even without a car in sight. Sometimes, I set out on walks only to stop at random, just to see what I can find. My soul gravitates to large cities; I find peace in the bustle. I believe good art can change the trajectory of your day, maybe even your life. Cheesy? Yes. True? Also yes. At least for me. 

In 2022, I published a little poetry book, Full, with my dear friend, Alex. Together, we explored the breadth of the human experience: the desire to create, to connect, to comprehend the world that we are living in. I found myself on an enormous high after its release, and, for a multitude of reasons and life changes, soon found myself in a tremendous low shortly after. I grew so frustrated: why couldn’t I let the joy last, why is it that every time I climb a mountain I remind myself that I will fall, and why this happens over and over and over again.

And like a sunburst, Cycles was born. Deeply personal (and by consequence, vulnerable), the following poems explore my recent ranges of emotion, from fears that I can never seem to definitively quiet to perspective shifts to see myself in a whole new light. Thank you for joining me on my journey, turbulence and all. 

Miya
goodbye 

Lovers leave me and I let them
Go with grace, a chaste
Kiss
My Mona Lisa smile, they stand in awe
My masterpiece I etched with selflessness and maturity
Come nightfall alone in a hollow room

Lovers leave me and I let them
I shoulder the magnitude of your decisions
Sitting in the rubble on a regular morning
Never looking our artifacts in the eyes
And pretend I am not shaken in the aftershock

Lovers leave me and I let them




Lovers leave me and I let them
I go to bed wishing them the best
And wake wishing I had stopped them

Lovers leave me and I am left with
Stanzas on repeat and cycles I can’t seem to shake

Lovers leave me

careless 
i’ve so carelessly used
love of my life
i worry for selves in different universes
for the young girl who stayed because she was comfortable
for the foolish who stayed bc she thought it was her duty to show the criminal he could be loved
for the 

A poet a romantic
The other selves who insist they found their person
they are liars b

Whenever it’s convenient!

Screaming
I want you to see me
Please could you just fucking look

Pleading
I made it so easy
I wrote it all in this fucking book
Oceans

she spent the day soaking in ocean brine
when she lays her head at night
she still feels the waves pulling
pushing further and further 
demigod

i’ve had a recurring dream
As I drift from my world,
He meets me every time.
A man that engulfs me and 
All fibers of my being

Eiffel tower kisses 

Swimming in cliff enclosed canyons

Gazes that could melt icecaps

jumping into volcanoes
hand in hand
emerging from the pit with lava soaked skin

a demigod quelling storms

Each night he sets me anew
To release me back to my state
a wisp of that yearning flame
rests on my shoulder all day
his whispers though fleeting
stick in my mind repeating

A spectre of 
Sentimental over your spectre

Fragments of men 
I’ve loved before

drowning

i wake with a start
heaving with all that haunts me
the same demons wake me
over and over
night after night
holding my head underwater
when i come up for breath
i cover my mouth
so you don’t hear me gasping
i’ve gotten used to
silently screaming
and smiling around you
i’ll let air return to my lungs
and look at you sleeping soundly
hoping you get rest
i lay my head down and drift
a raft that pulls me from consciousness
far enough to leave me useless
when your same demons wake you
and pull you under
i’ll scream from my distance
and watch you drown
i’ll wake with a start
and wait for my turn 
destruction

i want to destroy all that i’ve created
visceral

heaving
the shredded remains of shining

My life is a crime scene,
and you were careless with your fingerprints.
People walk through the yellow tape,
oblivious to the carnage you left behind.
I tense when they disturb your memory,
blurring your tracks and leaving me
stranded without your trace. They speed about 
while my leaded bones can barely stand.
I’ve taken to dusting the evidence,
packaging and putting you away.
Will this room ever be the same? 

My life is a demolition site
of a noble monument; now, nothing. 
Traces of its memory underneath my fingernails.
Four handprints in concrete
forgotten, made meaningless by your uncalloused hands.
Your signature and mine on 
crumpled blueprints to build,
Overwritten by your sole discretion to dismantle.
So graciously you left me in the rubble,
sentenced to clean one pebble at a time.
After you’ve seen destruction, 
Do you ever forget it?

My life is an abandoned library:
tomes of knowledge lost to ravages,
languages that no longer grace traveling tongues,
cobwebs bind pages where corners once folded.
Your specificities meticulously logged– 
notes scribbled in margins, marred by determined teardrops,
surfacing despite my best attempts to stifle them.
They mix with ink like how you took your coffee in the morning.
Clouds of milk that turn to ghosts at night.
Wisps of all your whispered promises,
Will this silence ever quiet down?

Oops

your words spilled ink
over all of my words

My words, unwavering and pure
Laid to rest without warning
My sincere sentiments presented
Adoration and love,
Wishes and wants, 
Once a home, now a haunt
I spilt milk and you spilt blood

You offer up your substandard eulogy,
Etched in a napkin at an empty funeral 
Infuriating. A bandaid over a broken leg insulting
Your irreverence inconceivable
On innocence, so criminal 
with these casualties. How casual 
you allow carelessness
Inflicting insignificance, permanence in
ink
Over all of my words

Blood from my bitten lip drips
In time with tipped ink
Stifling venom-laced vengeance
I hold my pointed tongue
Standing over the remains of all i once held precious
Water sloshing at my knees
In this tidal wave of erasure. Words 
are all a writer has and this writer’s words
you may no longer have.
You led us down this path and
I’m leaving you
The aftermath.


prescription

four years with a fish eye lens
i pushed my world 
to the periphery, bending my vision 
to your pedestal until
you shattered the glass

four years with a fish eye lens
broken in shards around
my bare feet. how pretty 
the light is
as it kisses the mosaic

four years with a fish eye lens
but now my sight 
is in perfect proportions
and how wide the world is
without you


Google Keep

poems that sit in notes on my phone
littered vulnerabilities
amongst flowers of life
flurries of petals encircle me gently
until a vortex appears
a pitfall out of my present moment
a hyper-fixation on making sense
of nothing and everything
i am still searching for color
its symbolism in paintings of the present
as if capturing beauty in brushstrokes
will make this moment last
gripping tightly on all that has passed 



Google Keep 2

poems that sit in notes on my phone
scribbles and musings
of a limited woman dreaming of genius
a historian buried in books
pouring into lores of universal connection
a cinematographer finding perfect lighting
illuminating the wonders i wish we could share
in the bending of a gentle breeze
fragrances of life encompassed
in sparks of written inspiration
lightning that strikes in between
grocery lists
and
reminders to call my friends

hi reader

are you dizzy?

do you need to take a break?

you can put this book down if you need.

is it too much?

am i making sense?

if i could i’d squeeze your hand
i can bring you a water or a pillow to rest
i know this is a lot to take in, to understand
i would never hold it against you if you left
Swing

swinging high
the second you are suspended in the air
hovering before returning to earth

i couldn’t fathom then
my love for you now
seeing you fly
is both my greatest joy
and deepest sorrow


Pillars

On three pillars I stand



Lola

A woman of strong faith and wit
Played the piano at church everyday
Teaching 

Finished sudoku puzzles in the newspaper
Books stuffed with stray papers and notes
Jottings of sayings her grandchildren would say
Funny things she swore to never forget


tatay

he was a stern man
a commanding presence
in a second his wintery face would melt
spring charisma held its grip on public attention

he had 8 children, four girls and four boys
it was his youngest, his little girl
who would clamber behind him
five tiny fingers wrapped around one of his

he left her by the door each morning
a powerful man by sheer means of his will
gravitating towards him
a man who had everything but still bought a lottery ticket
he dreamt of greatness when his eyes closed
and dared to dream with them open too

soon, his little girl grew up
she moved overseas but called each week
she bought a lottery ticket for him
hoping one day she could give him good news

his daughter had one of her own
an even tinier thing, hiding behind her leg
he wondered what she saw

A stern man, a commanding presence

she eyed him, unsure
shy

Lava

an active volcano
yearns for dormancy
as its molten emotions
terrorize the townspeople
Screens and stars

in desperate breath upwards i look to you
how small must i seem to you
your guidance i ask for this treacherous path

dark discs illuminated
by reflections from a screen
stars animated at the creator’s will
twirling through the black
an eternal dance spinning upon saturn's rings
liberated souls’ careless mark upon the night sky
how i long to let our worlds collide
so that i could sit in your presence for one last time
for you to descend from your celestial seat
to kiss my weary eyes, far too long fixated on imagined truths woven by empty dreamers
Ceramic

twisted figure molded out of clay,
candidly quite awkward to behold.
contortions on a spinning wheel;
globs of earth thrusted into fire,
its features set in a formative moment.

a figure, molded out of clay,
Twisted limbs and contortions
Spinning wheel performances


a potter, shaky but careful as can be,
makes hand etchings you can hardly see.
clumsy fingers clutching graceless art,
treasure glazed, then given to clueless
strangers holding an artist’s whole heart.

this tiny thing, my heart and strings
i weave, i leave to you
with tenderness, i bid
wander free
but never back to me

Artistic vision 2

walking in fields of wheat
golden grains bursting at a single touch
cotton like confetti carried
a singular wind in an otherwise frozen scene
Echo

in this cavern
sounds are louder
a sun so pervasive
no corner untouched
light that bleeds from
every opening
a concentrated ray
undeniable and indisputable

Hecate

Liminal
Faces

Check-in 2

Your writing is lazy. Your writing is repetitive. Say something new. Be you. Be original. Be fresh. Be authentic.

Rewrite after rewrite after rewrite. And then I’m left with Frankenstein for art, diluted and dissected until its essence obscured. 

I reread my work and it feels like reading a letter from a long lost friend. One who I can’t seem to remember clearly, yet feels so pivotal in the road to who I presently am. Estranged from myself. 


Meaningless

all these words, meaningless
they all say the same things

Pushing on the borders of my creativity 
Like running into a forcefield at the precipice of thought
Wishing for expanse
Wishing to be more than I am
Penmanship

for days, i practiced my penmanship
purposeful every shape, line
controlling every form of
perception



Narcissist

i'm shaking
writing every pressing thought
in reckless abandon
every lyrical moment
scrawled onto a page
a train barreling toward
the inevitable crash
a realization of a narcissist's
greatest fear
i have nothing to say



Resentment

i resent
popular poetry
pretty words
empty dreams
to see life as more
than all it is
my poetry partner forbids me from emotion

my poetry partner forbids me from emotion
a cautionary tale for premature celebration
that i will actively and blissfully ignore
entrenching scars flood with wisdom to the brim
this battle i have fought before
and it is now my war to win

in the face of a monster rearing its ugly head
my unwavering eyes look towards, facing forward
dig in my heels against its deafening roar
this time, there is no Oz; this gold is not gilded
i have lifted the curtain and all is as it seems
and in this glittering moment, full of emotion
finally, i find peace
bud

bud,
nestled in neglected dirt.
i cock my head,
my dark eyes follow
falling leaves,
curled at their blackened ends.
i encase this life in glass
sit back nefariously and
wait
for it to fully wither
at my wicked hands
bruised

love you blue
red blood flowing
gripping onto you

love you blue
purple splotches showing
hidden from view

love you blue
until i learn 
to love me too
Apparition

apparition, curved and coveted,
leaving wispy trails and
whispers in my periphery
teasing her presence
behind endless doors
in this corridor horizon

the vision of her flowing fabric
tightens its vice-grip on my mind
like the sight of water in sweltering heat
how long now have i lived in drought?
oh, how cruel her dissipating mirage!
i pull my knees into my chest
a sob croaks through cracked lips

flowing fabric
a train skirting at the edge of view
gently shakes me from this daze
apparition, curved and coveted
the air, crisp and gilded,

wispy trails in a hall of doors
whispers in the periphery

in this maze of halls and doors and mirrors


endless doors in this corridor horizon
dusty mirrors that line these walls
the air, crisp and gilded, hangs
onto this momentous present,
like a word gripping on the tip of my tongue
Searching

the fear that sets in
when things that made you feel alive
no longer do
the panic creeping in
as your mind begins to search
through every recess of your mind
what once brought me joy?
why don’t I feel that way anymore?

self-fulfilling

The funny thing about cycles is that i always tell myself i will fall
But in my lowest i never remember things are going to come back up
Tiptoe

We tiptoed into something casual
And you hit me like a truck
The signs were there, the inevitable fall
I thought i could resist you and i was wrong

This candle burns from both sides
Warmth on my skin, shining brightly
Lingering touch hot and sweet

I told you the ending would never hurt
As every song sweet screams your name

Main character

Want to be seen
Music and the media

A duty love can never fill
A hole your heart can’t fill

Looking for your likeness on screens
Between pages


Glass Case


encased in glass
strokes of paint

Art that fills every inch 
And i see no light


Epiphany

So I write the words I always want to hear

All along I thought this cycle was me standing up and my inner self tearing me down
When really the cycle has been me needing comfort
And never giving it to myself
I didn’t know how to ask and so I lashed out
The only thing I’ve ever wished for was to break this cycle
When I was the one perpetuating it
The cycle cannot break
But I see it more clearly
I promise to do better
Because I want to
I need to be my safest place
I need to be the person I go to




Picked the thorns off my branches
So it won’t hurt as much when I wrap my arms around myself
Take in clean air
And notice that colors after so vibrant 


I am

i am life sustaining
i am strong

winds kicked up by the
aurora of my everything
projecting forward

I am inferno incarnate

I have razed fields poisoned
Infested with weeds
This soil I see nothing but life
Golden wheat bursting at its touch

Fingertips that ease pain

Golden 

i am unabashedly happy
I am sad

i see good

i have been wandering in the dark
for years
and it was only until i stopped searching
that i could finally turn on the light

i can see myself so clearly
in every facet
i am undeniable 

I see life pouring from every crack of obscurity
Its energy flows into me

I close my eyes and I smile
I get to do this the next day
The privilege of being me in all its inclusions

Reclaim universe

I wrote you those words and promised you they would stay yours
So proudly I gave you
My adoration, my absolute, my art
So quickly you gave me
Your arguments, your apologies, your abandonment
But the second you said goodbye
I came to collect them
You don’t get to have my best
Imprisoned in your tallest tower
Without the slightest hint of light
I wrote these words 
In a time of love, of hope
They would be the last.
But now they are not.
You made sure of that.


The universe it grows
Like a blanket over existence
What I thought was a star has now reached its end
A supernova that burned once so bright
Is now just empty space
Dust
And the promise
For something new

Universe (circa 2018)

he was born just as the universe was, 
a singularity in time and space 
destined for expansion far beyond imagination. 
the universe in all its grandeur 
spreads neither thin nor destructively, 
growing beyond bounds, 
bravely moving forward where 
before, there was  
nothing. 
others see pockets of darkness; 
i see planetary potential,  
nothing less than quite simply  
beautiful in its sheer existence. 
his soul spans and stretches across 
the highest peaks of joy, 
valleys of grief, 
rolling plains of endless compassion. 
i could spend a lifetime and day 
exploring his topography, 
from every line on his face  
to each crevice on his body, 
yet still only grasp but a fraction 
of the profound depth of his emotion.

Welcome back

Plastic covered couch
Rosy hues color plaster white walls


Love greets me 
Faceless, nameless 
I hate this
Their ‘welcome back”
So smug, all-knowing
Dizzy from a carousel of potential
Another love that burned so bright
Left me like a wick burnt out
I want Love to be a person
Grounded in their specificities
That I could never fathom another
Rather, it seems Love is my home

My prodigal journey
Goodbye to my last love
Before I latch onto another


Never Change

i once held onto
“i hope you never change”
as a commandment
i squeezed myself into a box
i wanted to be steadfast
have strength of character
i wanted to be your home
i wanted to fall back into your embrace
and i wanted to feel like home

now i hope you hardly recognize me
i hope i am shining brighter than you ever imagined i could
i hope you see i’m stronger now
i bend life to my will
and if you stay long enough
standing in the center of the sun
you’ll know the home you built still stands
flowers have grown
the paint is 


Following

A trail of breadcrumbs
A child anxiously waiting
Who will play their game?


Happy birthday

happy birthday

i gave you sunshine
balmy weather after your self-inflicted storms

i gave you

safety
promises and dreams
visions of a future
bandages for your wounds

and then you left

i gave you 6 weeks of tears
out of respect for what we were
now the well is dry
and i have the whole world to present
self-addressed
out of respect for who i am 



pandora

i’ve kept my own pandora’s box
of feelings concealed
and fears you’d leave me
most days i had barely noticed them
but in turbulence they thrash
against cardboard walls
we held the lid together
four hands along its seam
you wagered to release them
surely they would dissipate into air
how beautiful it would be
to watch them rise into the sun
never to be seen again
you wanted to wish me freedom
from this burden i’ve been carrying
i stare incredulous
then look down at the part of myself
banging to get out
you assure me my fears would never happen
relegating to your steady eyes
i remove my hands from the lid
watch as ghostly hazes burst from the box
tearing paper walls to bits
your eyes grew wide
as they eclipsed the sun
they circled around us
i shut my eyes as i lost all trace of light
and in a sudden moment
they did as you said
they melted into air
slowly rising into a yellow sun
and there i sat
alone
but free
just as you said 
Bring your umbrella

California is drowning
The rain won’t stop
I sit in my room
Lights off
Candlelit
I like the way my eyes look
Illuminated by my phone screen
Hidden spring

It is not meant to rain in California
California is sun and light and warmth
On my face, seeping into my soul
 
It is not meant to rain in California
Yet the skies are bleached gray
Rain falls like sheets
 
I snuck into the outside
In between pours
The trees have yet to grow out their leaves
 
A tiny bird stands in my way
Looking at me
As if to tell me it had freshly learned to fly
And on its back
Revealed only when it spread its wings
I saw my California sun
In its yellow feathers
 
I took out my ear buds only to realize that these birds were everywhere
Their song filled the air
Trumpets triumphant falling on deaf ears
Chests puffed, feathers red
Chasing each other through the sky
Weaving through the gray
 
Spring was upon me
And I didn’t even realize  







New Poem

The first I love you like acoustic guitar
Resonant strings 

An acoustic realization of love
Resonance in quiet stadium sound




Another rain poem evidently

the california sun reared its holy head
weeks after ignoring shouting and pleading for the rain to cease
water sprung from my once arid eyes





Sitting at a peak

A seat for one
Atop a mountain peak
I sit and stay
I’ve waited long enough
For one to climb my winding trail
The view up here is nice
The wind is gentle
When the fog lifts you’ll see towns and mountains



Who am i?

armada of past selves
phantasms single file
obstructions in my line of sight
they ponder me, knowing




Crows and flowers

my neighbor’s flowers grow into my backyard
fuchsia petals draped on tall stucco walls
a crow bounces in the branches
to peck amongst the leaves
back and forth it bounds along
chipper as it chirps through
trampling over flowers that were never meant to bloom
 


the pursuit of love

i've always fallen
heart first, head second
hands ready
to brace for impact
cushion the fall and continuing on
the pursuit of love as my unhealthy sport
sprinting past signs to stop
giving all i had to
salesmen in their snakeskin suits
and broken boys who never wanted me to begin with
times captive, times begging to be kept,
love i've seen from every facet
and still i chase
fearless and unrelenting
feeling strong in my chest laid bare
scarred but still invincible

whatever you want, however you want, i’m here for it all.

your for now, your forever
whatever destiny decrees
i am meant to be
time its noble appointed storyteller 




A haiku

Stepping out into the world
I realized how much I had to lose
And promptly retreated




So easy to be strong without practice

Cloud shrouded buildings




Pebbles and rocks

your absence hits me like
a hazy dream. pain that has already 
tumbled 
      past 
    the roots 
          and soil 
and trickles down through pebbles and rocks
a shadowy figure lurking in happy moments
sitting on its opportunity to strike
i wake knowing the threat no longer exists
and clamber out
of bed feeling as if i had forgotten
something important




to my future love

i'll find you under a rock
and wish i had fallen sooner

i’ll wear your shirt and your smell will linger and this time it won’t choke me in my memories

he inspires poems that i never finish
because they are never truly done

dead leaves the color of sickly skin
cling to winding branches
naked on crooked trunks
clouds condensed shades of gray
today blue is peeking through



I really am trying to get out of this
Rock climbing

Person sits
Seeming to enjoy the surroundings

Person sits
For how long

Person sits
Ankle swelling
Palm is cut wide open
Scars that have faded
Gashes picked at that

Person sits
We aren’t even sure she plans on moving






some people hate the journey

some people cry thinking about it being over




Poem that this isn’t a monster
This is just a person who is scared and hurt




I am a good person
I am someone who is exciting
And fresh

I search for warmth

These days i sit outside a door
And knock 




I lose sleep
And like clockwork
The delusions waltz in
They dance around me
And climb over walls
The waters rose 
The elements settle in
I see things ive seen before
And they feel stronger 
The warm light burns stronger 
Blind i am bathing in its embrace
Rainy days are set to soft jazz
And my head burns 
The weightiness of my existence
At the core of a dizzy world
Self inflicted intoxication 
Insomnia is my drug
And there is beauty in riding its high


Dwelling

My love tucks me in
After i have run through the fields
Pricks on my feet
Dandelion fuzz in tangles in my hair
He puts me in blankets to tell me it is time to stop
Put me to rest
I wonder what he hopes for come morning
I wonder what I would become without this bed


Final project - translation
Poem without words



We are at war. We are losing. We are trying. We are human. 

I dragged my foot along the page and my leaden sole smudged pencil sentences in a hazy trail behind me. I look down. I look up. I look every which way except forward. 



Bombs are dropping

I am terrified of misinformation
I am terrified of being the one who spreads it
I am terrified

This is so important
There is nothing I can do
How could I do nothing?

Posting seems so performative
People post on social media impact statements and pictures with bold letters and they all say that if i say nothing i am doing so wrong
Why should I feel better if I tap my thumb a couple times
And have an infographic that’ll disappear after 24 hours
Why am I making it about me
People are dying
People are dying
People are dying


There isn’t a political stance in your writing. Everyone has a political stance. What do you believe in? What do you 


If I have loved you before, and do not now, please read this.

I know what love should be now. I know what I want it to be.

I don’t like being strong 
I don’t like having it all together
I don’t like 


I love a man 
I wish I had a more creative way to say it
I wish I had a better way to say that I cherish him



I am afraid of breaking things
You make me feel like i can breathe
You make me wish i could write the most beautiful thing i have ever written


I love you 
That i never want you to end


I laid all these people in the dirt
Folded up retributions 
My origami swans i let pass on the lake
Orbs of dew lay on the petals
Towering over mounds of dirt 
In this moment i feel full and whole



Sleepwalker

The authorities found her. 
Huddled over, caked in dirt from the freshly turned soil she knelt in
Fists clenched almost as tight as her eyes were shut.
A trail of graves in bulldozed peace snaked behind her
Screams scattered crows.
Hands battered the earth below.

You can’t disturb a sleepwalker.

The authorities nodded. 
Slow to turn around, peel their eyes from the wreckage
She’ll deal with the aftermath of her actions
When the sun has risen
And she can see again.





There is a voice inside my head telling me if i disappear quietly, slowly, no one would notice. It’s okay. It’s no one’s job to make

I ate a persimmon

The squishiest part of a crimson Hachiya persimmon
Custardy, perfectly ready in its moment 

Fall’s treasure

My rants about this fruit have wound around the world
I bit into it 
Mealy
I stayed with the stout Fuyu 



GAF Artist Statement - Answers Pending

In my art, I hope to bring the audience closer to my world, my poems serving as a transcription of my innermost thoughts and feelings. I made this series of poems to explore the associated jumble emotions orbiting around heartbreak: loss, anger, questioning, to name a few. Through a series of metaphors, I sought to visualize and illustrate the changes that are so embedded in that state of mind, a worldview that is often invisible to those around. I thought deeply about the ways that image shifts and reverts in the healing process, yet as a whole felt like a singular feeling. Although each poem asks a different question, ultimately I found their answers to be the same and underlying within the words I was writing. 






Thesis project work

Look at this beautiful thing
Look at this wonderful person 


bones, bones, bones

i live in a city of bones
alone yet never alone
i think of you fondly
and i carry you home
fingers strum strings cold
extra voices echo bones
i am big and brittle; city, little
all together wispy ghosts
alive in the city of bones


I talk too much

Stop talking
It’s sentence 5
Maybe sentence 6 
And you need to stop
By this time 
Im looking at eyes
Begging someone to stop me
My heart pumps like an engine
And my mouth keeps on going
On going
On going

Introduction


The creation of this book comes as a surprise to no one more than us, two acquaintances, three time zones apart, who shared a brief online conversation perhaps once a month before beginning this project. A modest suggestion to read poetry together every week one fateful winter night (a night notably colder for one author, not basking in the balmy California climate) turned into a regularly scheduled celebration of the written word. After a few months of simply reading, our own emotions and ideas ripened to bursting; thus we decided to end our mere consumption and take up the inky pen (or clackity keyboard). Nervous prefaces prior to reading our poems, after some weeks of writing and sharing, soon grew scarce. We unearthed newfound confidence in both our individual creative abilities and the trust that our most vulnerable musings would be met with unending empathy and warmth. We continued to challenge ourselves, creating new tasks to complete every week. Finally, we decided that what began as an off-hand comment was something that deserved to be shared—and thus this project was born. Our circle of safety where we shared our thoughts is expanding its radius ever so slightly. 
	The astute reader may notice that we seem to copy a few of each other’s lines throughout the anthology—and it’s no slip of the pen. Many of our poems started as shared lines of inspiration—a shared theme, key word or sometimes, direct inspiration from a previous poem. It provided a means for us to evoke a similar theme and explore topics together. When you notice these, just think of them as sister poems, born from the same idea, mood and week of inspiration.
Our initial conception of this book opted to host sections containing the “themes” of our poems—but we decided that such a structure would deny our poems the living breath they hold. The initial idea of compartmentalizing our poems emerged from a bristling fear of our feelings being somehow less legible unless somehow sorted neatly into boxes. Luckily, our fears found respite in our confidence in each other. We envision our anthology as a turbulent movement—each flowing (not seamlessly) into the next. That is to say, each poem stands well-defined on its own but to isolate them would be to deny them their becoming life. They share their deepest intimacies with their neighbors just as we the authors have done in our many meetings. We humbly thank you for doing so, as the addition of your own experiences and perspectives adds color to our art in ways we could have never imagined. 


Through These Words
By Miya

My fingertips caress this soft page,
Bent and worn with every clutch
Upon the unexpected. Placement
Of punctuation, words thoughtfully chosen, 
Connotations concealed lurking in deposits beneath 
Inky rivers scrawled across untouched land.
Bristles on this brush
Against accumulated dust
Uncover slowly, painstakingly,
An artifact so perfectly preserved.
On which, a visionary penned the
Indescribable 
To paper. In a flash,
In vivid colors, In tangible moments,
Unfolds scenes frozen in time, 
A kaleidoscopic lens of your magnificent world—
Whispers of hidden voices,
Sunlight on your face atop the mountain,
Screams that echo in the valleys of your emotion.
On unremarkable days, I bask in your light
Emanated by scribbled ink. I read these
Words
And feel your soul:
A mirror in which I see myself—
Not too much, just enough
To stop feeling alone,
But still feel different.

A shiver electric through my skin.
A body shifts in the ground: the release of
A soul exclaiming in sweet relief.
Rejoice! Someone,
Finally,
Has heard them.






An Unlikely Fascination with Birds
By Miya

An ox nestles in rolling meadows.
Tall grass waving amiably in the wind
To this peculiar, burly fellow, still as stone,
Eyes to the sky as winged friends pass him.

Sitting, People Watching
By Miya

9 pm, sitting idly by a bustling road.
Casting puzzled glances, people briskly
Pass me, planted next to unkempt roses, alone.
Intent on warm destinations, and there sits me,
A willing witness to a world willed slow.




Latch
By Miya

Bouts of laughter I often hear,
Animated eyes and involuntary squeals.
Engrossing recounts of exciting lives lived.
Orchestral mirth, unrehearsed, swells in sound,
Despite not one conductor around.
Linked arm in arm down this narrow path,
Four feet in perfect stride, they march 
As if no time has passed.

Those faces I have grown so fond of, but
‘Tis their backs that feel like home.
I watch them walk with their bubbling talk.
Fragments of tales that float on by
Trickle to my eager ears as I trail behind. 
Like smoke that spirals into view
From the hearth that is burning inside.
A nearly thawing sight.

Through the gate they go, the door swings closed
Before opening once more its wrought mouth wide.
My outstretched hand met with the hinges’ cry.
The strike of the clasp - a clang of metal resounding.
Again and again, the gate rebounding.
Repeated reminders with each dissonant ring, caution!
An all-at-once, definitive shut, forewarning the final lock.
Alone, still, on the other side, I smile as I resign.




Waking
By Alex

Vigilant, focused
In familiar territory.
Cyclic, practiced
Movements.
The world sighs with the breeze, I
Take a breath.

Where have I been?


Classical Master
By Miya

Globs of mismatched paint.
Brushstrokes in drunken stupor.
Resonating view.



Half Past Ten
By Miya

Every morning at half past ten,
with shoulders warm and red,
a woman waits and longs for shade
under rippling rays and gasoline haze.

She clutches a tattered cloth purse
as rubber sandals climb each step.
Fingers fumble at the clasp and a curse 
is muttered under breath.

Coins clang down the machine.
She ambles by a row of empty seats.
At last, exhaling as she settles into 
the second seat that’s free.

Handkerchief to her lips, breathing in
Scents of detergent and her own sweat mingling,
lingering a moment before shaky hands dab 
at rolling droplets down tan, leather skin.

Wheels wheeze, turning slow
Entering the flow of streets that teem.
Horns honk, lurching stops taken like 
the ocean tide, oblivious to the world outside.

The symphony of a busy city,
cacophony of conversations colliding—
nothing but background music to thoughts
I am not privy to. For

Every morning quarter past ten,
I wait patiently to watch the scene unfold, 
Puzzled by the fondness and warmth I hold 
for the woman without a name.

Uncharted Expedition
By Miya

Who dares venture there?
Cascades of vivid yellow trees
Burgeoning at the base of a mountain, 
Pushing brazenly to the forefront
Alongside verdant evergreens, eagerly
Multiplying! Spreading! Stretching
To the sky in aimless desperation 
As they grow sparse in elevation.
Futile efforts to conceal towering rock and dust,
The gray mass on which they stand, and
A peak yet untouched.




Steadying Breath
By Miya

I count to ten,  
and I exhale 
until my brain is hyper-aware of 
the emptiness of my lungs 
and the heaviness of my heart, 
brimming with the hope 
that someday soon you will come 
to fill the space.




Hope and Revelations
By Miya

And he came forward. 
So close I could see 
the hope gleaming in his eyes.  
Deep and dark, his eyes revealed  
every kiss he’s ever received,  
every hand outstretched and left empty,  
and the bird in his ribcage  
that slept through winter  
and is now ready for spring.


May Prayers
By Miya

May music lull softly in your ear—
The notes drifting aimlessly,
Strolling along the corridors of your mind
In joyous golden harmony.

May you dance on the sandy beaches
Of happiness, barefoot and free,
The moon reflecting your jubilance
Over the calm expanses of the sea.

May your heart be stitched clumsily onto your sleeve
In a perfectly misshapen display
For unscrupulous souls to cling onto
To patch their own broken ways.









Pop
By Miya

Memories of me float past your eyes.
Reflections in globular bubbles
gleam in high beam lights,
sparkling on summer days.
Melted popsicle sticks in a pool of cherry red,
Bike tires screeching on sidewalks,
Rays in waves around lines of sight,
Crooked tooth smiles and 
Blue ribbon dresses.
Cracking open cans of soda 

                                pop.
Look at me now.
Who do you see?


Pigeon in New York City
By Miya

Staring expectantly at my own hazy outline,
A reflection separate from the bustle behind.
For days here I stand firmly until I find

A crumbling roof and cracking glass overhead.
Tucked wings remain still, my unused assets
Bound by gravity, grounded until I forget

My Brothers, Sisters, Comrades and Foes-
The flap of their wings, caws ring unenclosed.
Feathers falling from the sky landing below

Me, daring to take a step.




Fall
By Miya

A somber summer’s day
crashing like waves against the bluff.
Coming, each step towards me
And further from the you I hold dear.
Tangled grass grips, fastened 
to my place, hopeless. 
You gaze towards me. But only
yearning what’s beyond, never
meeting the plea in my eyes.

You leap and I fall
Behind in your wake.



High Castle
By Miya

time lagging,
change imperceptible.
waving white flags
to high castle impenetrable
as I retreat to my lowly fortress
to live behind locked doors and
a crack I carved in secrecy.
outside phantoms prowl,
protection from this person,
ghosts haunting as I hide.
they see through my eyes.
they speak with my mouth.
change imperceptible,
time lagging.



World Views
By Miya

Rope swing on a hill.
No land or sea left unseen.
Go tumbling down.




Running
By Miya

Running me ragged.
No way to get past it.
Breathless and lost
As I’m fighting this fog
Looming overhead,
Threats with every step.
Each stumble I hear
The voices of those I hold dear.
Tremble in my place
Alone in this haze
You must be asking who
Dares hold me in pursuit?
Prodding on tightrope,
‘Tis none other than hope
Running me ragged.
No way to get past it.




Summer Daze
By Miya

Summer in all its passions
and gilded in all its glory
still seems to slip away.

Sunlight in abundance
set to stall my slumber
til night consumes the day.

Summer in all its promises
pacts to lovers and to friends
(All these I have yet to keep).

Summer the source
for all this emptiness.
No one to blame but me.


Wine Stains
By Miya

I wrote about wine
Before I even took a sip.
Intoxicated in his eyes,
In proximity to his fire.
A flower before its bloom
Revels in new warmth on its skin.
Sing me to sleep, the baby cried,
With your voice like red wine.
Chasing an idealistic phantom buzz
Coursing through my mind.

I took a sip.
Those bitter tastes linger 
Forever entwined to this day
Though the glass has since 
Shattered, spilled and stained
Time-worn sleeves that should be
Housing this heart as it beats.
My sober heart retreats into
This ribcage of tendrils,
Singed from naive musings: 
What did I have to lose?


World Outside the Window
By Miya

A hummingbird gleams,
In hues of green and blue.
Revolutions that surround me,
Flitting in and out of view.

Retreat far beyond this pane,
Return in the blink of a season. 
Repeated change, internalized pain:
The world in which we live in.






Artistic Vision
By Miya

I close my eyes— 
my mind places me 
barefoot 
on rocky pacific shores. 
Wearing nothing but a loose dress, 
thin, colorless, and 
painfully unequipped  
to shield me from the cold. 
My skin sticks from the salty air; 
my untied hair battered from violent gusts; 
my eyes squinting 
to find where the sky meets the sea, 
like searching for a line in a  
watercolor canvas of  
melancholy blues,  
domineering grays, and  
apathetic white. 
Thankfully, I am alone here, 
for when the ocean pushes against the land,
no one but 
me 
will be swept in its undertow.



Instinct
By Miya

Wishful thinking to perpetuate this stillness. 
A plaster statue buffeted by sudden winds.
Each singular moment bleeds into the next:
Supple waves spanning further than I can see
Pulses surging over once smooth waters,
Ripples expanding their radius to threaten me
As I remain crouching in this riverbank,
Concealed by tall grass. Eyes darting for 
Any sign of movement, pondering if today will be
Fight or Flight.




Weighted Blankets
By Miya

Tucked under heavy sheets
in a room where the darkness
casts its own shadowed light.
Sinking deeper under covers,
Undercover facades, facets of
life throughout time,
dance in my mind, projected onto
walls that will likely outlast me.

To familiar eyes,
I cry: Were you happy? 
Existing as a hollow shell 
of spun sugar dreams and
compliments of neighbors,
many who grew to abhor you.
Layers of blankets protect a sickly soul.
For those gossamer threads
have long since melted, revealing
a shriveled core exposed, yet
more whole,
than during ever passing seasons.


Listening
By Miya

I stay awake 
To listen to the gentle breath of my grandmother, 
To distant engines on long journeys, 
To the bird’s morning song,
No call unanswered.

I stay awake 
To watch the sky turn a light gray, 
My ceiling dimly lit by daybreak.
The silhouettes of my room slowly sharpen  
Until I see faint shapes of furniture.

I stay awake  
For my restless heart to crawl into the crevasses of my mind 
To sink into corners that my light
Of rationality and hope has yet to illuminate.
There, it festers as the blackness encompasses me.

I stay awake 
As I let it take over me 
Like an oil spill over the ocean of my eyes,
Await for the sun to shine once again,
Iridescent light refracted upon dark irises wide.



Molting
By Miya

Spring dew on small leaves—
Those that braved winter chills 
And survived to see the sun.
Bare, twisted branches
No longer knock at frigid panes.
Shadows unravel and reveal 
Life abound, teeming
With all I had yet to see.

A lizard, anxious to settle in light,
Glimmers in the morning sun
Freshly set free 
of gray, flaking skin.
For somewhere there,
It’s lurking 
Underneath the surface:
New, yet still familiar:
A soul reawakening, 
Pushing for first breath
After what feels like a lifetime 
of embryonic sleep.


Human
By Miya

Grounded, deliberate movements
To feel these bones click into place,
Muscles breeding tension with
Every bend and extension,
Pangs that greet me at every limit
Like the embrace of a companion
Before the journey returning home.
Carry-ons of comfort in this
Corporeal pound of flesh,
The privilege to call my own.




The Last Act
By Miya

The curtains slowly raise.
Figure frozen midway 
through a slow pirouette: 
soft bends along the forearms, 
fingers stretched to their ends.  
Soft light illuminates hair 
as it falls in gentle waves
matted in sweat, delicate twists
along the neck and face.

Those first gradual movements 
now furiously unfurl and flow,
fighting limitations of this closed 
form.
Within a fleshy cage, a
void
pulses, fervent for the freedom of release 
knowing all the while
liberation equates destruction.

At last! the final bow:
hands gripping and head down.
airs of defiance in desperate breath.
Every fiber of being, every muscle, flexed.
Tensed, lest we succumb to sweet collapse:
a figure left panting as the audience claps.
Exhausted to the bones, not a move left to give,
the internal flurry, insurgent under skin,
to settle until the curtains raise yet again.

Row by row, patrons stand up to leave.
Slipping from their seats,
forgotten programmes read:
Empty space—beyond logic—
shapes both curves and ridges,
the subjects of adoration and applause.
fluid physical motion, steeped in years 
of practiced technique, alongside 
geographic range of emotion, spanning everything
and nothing
in perfect synchronicity.



Full



By Miya

I wish you greetings as you emerge,
Step after steep bus step,
Settling in your seat and join in 
A chorus, raucous, unapologetic.

I wish you hands on your knees, 
Gasping for breath, feet that won’t
Move another step, as others cross 
The finish line and into open arms.

I wish you the exact moment
You first heard your favorite song, 
That critical, unbounded second
Your soul first learned to sing.

I wish you object throwing, 
Profanity flowing, fists curled tight
And knuckles white over blood
Drawn against your own palms.

I wish you days stuck in the rain, 
Sopping wet, socks soaked, so
Ankle deep in rushing water
You forget what it means to be dry.

I wish you eerie mornings, hints of sun 
Peeking through dusty blinds 
That haven’t been opened in ages
Until, perhaps, today. 

These I wish and so much more:
The full extent of every emotion
On the grand scale of your
Short-lived, brilliant human existence.



community garden

the plant in the windowsill has not seen 
water in how many days
it listens as the faucet drips and the boards creak
the basin fills and the laundry still 
intertwines with water from the wash

bulbs blink at crumbs from bagels from 
the deli down the street
they fell into the crevices of 
the table that took days to clean
the tile crumbles underneath jars of 
sugar and salt 

i address my comrades on a
chair i built with screws and sweat and
cries for a carpenter to come
my shadows from the lamp dance on the walls
by a desk that sways; it is
the ocean and i, the moon



She

She swings her hair, she sways her hips
She runs my thumb against her lip

She feasts on auras, she mirrors looks
She stamps her initials in library books

She hammers, she nails
She trips down the stairs

She sets the fire, she stands to watch
She washes her hands of the blood

She is honeysuckle, she is wheat
She spills her fragrance in the streets 

She glows, she brims
She sewed her outlines into my skin

She will not fade though she cannot be
She is all we see 



Wash and Dry

Turned on the washing machine – 
The rumbles sound like rain.
It hides the i miss yous,
Highlights what I’m holding onto:
You
	Your electricity surges
	Your memory precipitates
	Your love lingers

I duck under thunder.
I rejoice in my respite.
The suds turn,
Irreverently,
Like you did. This time
The bloodstains from your knife 
Evaporate and the dryer cycle begins.



Grandma?

I thought

I lost my grandmother in Larkin Park
My mind wandered up the branches
And my eyes chose to follow. Her
Laugh and laugh and laugh
I (surely) could hear her pass
I did not! Lose sight of her
Skin and bones hobble slow






Fuji

Fuck!
This apple sucks
I don’t know how
To pick fruit
I just chose it
I grinned as
I dropped them in the cart
I bought the bag
	I brought them home
I told a stranger it was my 
Apple slices
And peanut butter
Era
But fuck
These apples suck

Stop.
Eating.
Lift up your shirt in the mirror.
Why do you let wisps of men
Speak in your mind?

-do not be a fraction of who you were meant to be



i am the only thing that won’t fade away
despite my best attempts 

(Right page)
He could piss in the flowerbed
and i would still tend to the soil



that place was a passage
men against the walls
grabbing at our sleeves
they want to take what
makes us powerful
they cannot take
what is not theirs
what never could be theirs

-we are all just passing through | we will go on




(Right page)
She wakes
At dawn
To the sound
Of a 
Child
That is not hers
She soothes him
Charcoal on his fair skin
She pretends she can see her blood in him
She coos at a child with stubby hands at her collar
As oil from the pan leaps to onto a milky egg
When the moon turns
She serves coffee and sugar
Bread and butter in a basket
The baby wails for his mother’s skin
Who smiles coolly 
As she basks in steam from her cup 
How could anyone ever leave their child?

She wakes before dawn to the sound of a child
That is not hers. The baby cries. The baby cries. The baby
Cries. She rushes to him. His skin glows in the night.
She soothes him in the way she knows how while her body
Weeps for the child that haunts her dreams each night. 
Tenderly she picks up the child before her, She is afraid 
of rubbing charcoal on his fair skin. She can’t help but pretend
To see her blood in him as he looks up at her innocently.

She carries the child upstairs and coos at him. His stubby hands 
at her collar. The baby sighs. The baby sigh. The baby
Sighs. He is whisked across the kitchen.
Oil from the pan leaps onto a milky egg
Timers on toasters tick. She finds herself explaining her every move
To a child who has not yet had language grace his tongue
She covers his ear as the kettle screeches
This is not his world

She settles the child into his chair at the table as 
the white moon turns. The baby tries. The baby tries. The baby
Tries to find his mother. His mother descends from her bedroom
To the table, pouring milk and sugar into her coffee
As her baby wails for her skin
She smiles coolly as she basks in steam from her cup
How could anyone ever leave their child? She says
Just loud enough for the kitchen to hear


The words
‘Love of my life’
Have so carelessly come out of my mouth
That i cannot help but feel
Sorry
And
Scared
The longer your skin is on mine



(Right page)
she spent the day soaking in ocean brine
when she lays her head at night
she still feels the waves pulling
pushing further and further 



seeing you fly
is both my greatest joy
and deepest sorrow

(Right page)
you are beautiful except for your color
so pretty but so dark
you spent all day in the sun and now you suffer the consequences



I do not accept gifts
I do not want reminders you were here
After you have gone


(Right page)
If you spend so long focusing on the woman you want to be
You lose out on seeing the woman you are now



My mother cooked potatoes
She would place them in the oven
And i would watch their skin blister
With my face behind the glass
My mother would remove the tray
Hurriedly i would tear into them
Steam rushing out of them
I would follow its path until it 
Disappeared
Above me
I would wonder where it was going
Until i remembered its flesh was before me
And i ate

-consume



(Right page)
i lay down and feel.
spiders. 
all over me.
when it is just 
my hair 
that has fallen 
from my head
and my mind 
playing tricks on 
Me.
